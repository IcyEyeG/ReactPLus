# ReactPlus!

ReactPlus! is a [libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre) theme collection modeled after the [Microsoft Plus!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Plus!) series of software and designed with [ReactOS](https://www.reactos.org) in mind. 

>For using ReacPlus assets on Linux, visit the [ReacPlusYaru](https://github.com/IcyEyeG/ReactPlusYaru) project.

## Contents

ReactPlus! doesn't currently use visual styles, and conforms to the [Windows Theme File Format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/controls/themesfileformat-overview) up to Windows XP.

> ❌ denotes missing feature, pull requests welcome (see "Contributing" section bellow). Tango assets are used as placeholders for wallpapers and icons.

> It should be noted that the Space theme includes support for slideshows, but is commented out, as it's intended to be for testing purposes should ReactOS implement it.

## Contributing

Contributions, bug reports, forks and pull requests welcome! The general goals of this project are:

### Short-term goals

* Implement missing wallpapers and improve current selection if needed;
* Document Microsoft Plus! themes that serve as inspiration for ReactPlus! to become design guidelines.

Example:

| Full name | From | Wallpaper | Icons | Cursors | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dangerous Creatures | Microsoft Plus! | A cougar | My Documents: N/A<br />My Computer: a poison dart frog<br />Network Neighborhood: a tarantula<br />Recycler (empty): an unpuffed blowfish<br />Recycler (full): a puffed blowfish | General style: classic 3D cursors, light grey<br />Busy cursor: a Portuguese man o' war (animated)<br />Wait cursor: a wasp (animated) | Optimized for 256 color |

### Mid-term goals

* Implement documentation as a wiki and also include reference colors, fonts and metrics;

* Create a branch featuring dark themes;

* Investigate similar libre fonts to the ones used in Microsoft Plus! themes;

* Design missing icons and cursors;

* Design missing sounds.

### Long-term goals

* Create a branch using variations of the ReactOS Lautus visual style;

* Design and code missing screensavers;

* Design and code a Plus!98 style theme manager with additional support for XP visual styles.

### Optional goal

* Create a branch compatible with Windows 7 and 10, using Aero.
